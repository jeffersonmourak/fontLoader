This project is a TrueType font loader written in Swift.

Simply put, a font loader is the component that reads a font file (like a .ttf file for TrueType fonts) and extracts all the essential information about the font â€“ its characters, shapes, spacing, and other properties. It's like unpacking a box of building blocks for letters, making them ready to be used.

This Swift project provides the tools to load TrueType font files and make their data accessible within your Swift applications, so you can then use that information for tasks like rendering or text measurement.
